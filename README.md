# HookHttps

HookHTTPS is a tool used in Roblox to intercept and monitor HTTPS requests and responses, allowing developers to capture and analyze data, including GUI URLs and more. Note: this may not work with all scripts.

# How to Use:

1. **Get an Executor**: First, you need an executor such as ArceusX, CodeX, or VegaX.
2. **Access the Console**:
   - If your executor supports a console inside the executor, use it to see the URLs.
   - If your executor doesn't support this, type `/Console` in the chat to view the URLs.

# How to Copy URLs:
- Use Google Lens.
- Use Circle2Search.
- Manually write down the URL.
